## Educational Value
### This game is meant to help kids (and adults alike) learn addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in a fun and unique way



## Point of the game
### The point of the game is to "eat" all of the squares and end the game with a very high score
### When you eat a square, an random operation is performed on your current square with the number of the square you just ate



## Rules
### When you eat all of the squares, the game is over and your score is displayed
### When you divide by zero, the game is over and your final score is undefined (Because dividing by zero can either be 0 or infinity)
### Moving on squares you have already eaten is allowed, and that will not change your current operation
### Moving on a square you have not yet eaten will change your current operation and the next four operations



## Map
### The map shows which squares you have not yet eaten, the squares you have eaten, and the square you are on
### Squares you have eaten are in green
### Squares you have not yet eaten are in red
### The square you are on is in black



## Text at the top
### The text at the top shows the next four operations, and your current operation
### Below that is your current score
